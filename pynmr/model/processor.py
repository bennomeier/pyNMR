# this file needs more thinking.

# every operation has a name, and a bunch of (named) parameters with associated values
# sometimes a text entry is sensible for the input, sometimes a slider might be preferred.

# It is conceivable to write a class for every operation.
# This might be sensible, because every operation may need a custom widget anyway,
# along with a corresponding class.
